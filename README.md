# 📊 **Power BI Global Population Dashboard**  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on creating an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to analyze **global population trends from 1960 to 2050**. The dashboard helps **policymakers and the public** explore **demographic insights** across **different regions and income groups**.  

## 📂 **Dataset**  
- **Global Population Estimates & Projections (1960-2050)**  
- **Country Groupings Dataset** (regional & income-based classifications)  

## 🔍 **Methodology & Steps**  

### **1️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
✔ Analyzed dataset structure and key trends.  
✔ Identified population growth patterns & demographic shifts.  

### **2️⃣ Data Visualization in Power BI**  
✔ Created **interactive visuals** for population distribution, urbanization, and life expectancy.  
✔ Used **KPIs, Line Charts, Tree Maps, Scatter Plots, Bar Charts, and Pie Charts**.  
✔ Designed **single-screen dashboards** for effective data storytelling.  

### **3️⃣ Advanced Power BI Features**  
✔ Implemented **hierarchies, grouping, binning, and forecasting**.  
✔ Used **drill-through pages & slicers** for enhanced user interactivity.  

### **4️⃣ DAX Formulas & Calculations**  
✔ Applied **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to compute:  
   - **Population Growth Rates**  
   - **Year-over-Year Changes**  
   - **Comparative Metrics by Region & Income Level**
